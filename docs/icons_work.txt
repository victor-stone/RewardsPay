The following is breakdown of the icon work needed as 
of Oct. 6, 2013. Final version MUST be submitted no
later than Oct. 12, 2013.

All images must be in PNG format. All must have 
transparent background (except for the Launch Screens.)

App Icons:
========================= 

The "app icon" is the icon that the user taps on the home
screen to start the app. The same image is used in the
Settings app, as well as Spotlight search.

App icon sizes are discussed in some detail here:

ArgoPay wants all the image to be the same: the ArgoPay
Logo with a transparent background.

The current placeholder is a version of the logo but it 
has a white background.

The sized needed are in the left column below along
with a reference for where they are going to be used.

Please use the name in the right column when submitting
the final icons.

120x120 (iOS7)                              appIcon120.png

Spotlight/Settings

58x58 (iPhone iOS6 Retina)                  appIcon58.png
80x80 (iOS7)                                appIcon80.png

Launch Screen
===============

The launch (or "splash" screen") is displayed by iOS while
the app is loading/launching. There are 3 sizes needed by 
iOS. Please use the names on the right when submitting
the final versions.

320x480 (non-retina)                        Default.png
640x960 (retina)                            Default@2x.png
640x1136 (retina 4-inch)                    Default-568h@2x.png


Navigation Bar Items
=======================

These items will appear in the navigation bar at the top of the screen
along with the title of the screen (under the status bar which has
the batter life, connectivity info, etc.)

Artist should be familiar with Apple guidelines
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Bars.html

There are placeholder icons but the artist is required to
create new ones based on industry standard representations
of the relevant functionality (e.g. log in, sort, home, etc.)

The current placeholder icons are all over the map with regard
to size. All of these must be replaced with icons that are
exactly these sizes:

20x20 (non-retina)
40x40 (retina aka: @2x version)

The 40x40 version of any given icon does NOT have to be identical 
to its corresponding smaller version and in fact, should have more 
detail than the 20x20 equivalent version when that makes esthetic
sense.

The icons should be (mainly) white as they will be silhouetted by
iOS once placed in the navigation bar.
 
Please use the naming convention of the placeholder icons:

kImageNAME.png    - for the 20x20 version
kImageNAME@2x.png - for the 40x40 version

Where 'NAME' is the exact name (case sensitive!) given in the 
list below:

kImageBack.png    - A replica of the iOS 'Back' button
kImageHome.png    - Takes the user to the 'home' screen
kImageLogin.png   - Displays the log in screen
kImageLogout.png  - Logs the user out and notifies the user
kImageMapView.png - Display a map of nearby business with 'pins'
                    representing the locations
kImageMapList.png - Display list version of the screen above
kImageSort.png    - Display a list of sort options for the current
                    list
                    
Miscellaneous Screens
========================
There is one screen that has two pieces of graphics:

kImageTransactionTop.png
kImageTransactionBottom.png

With their @2x counterparts.

These PNG files were (hastily) cut out of the original
"transaction.psd" file that can be found in this ZIP
archive. As you can see the images are fuzzy and not
"clean." 

Please replace these PNGs with their equivalents keeping
the EXACT sizes in the PNG.
